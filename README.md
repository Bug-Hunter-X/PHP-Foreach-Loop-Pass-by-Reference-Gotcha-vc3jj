This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to the pass-by-reference behavior of foreach loops. The `bug.php` file contains code that exhibits the unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.  The issue stems from the way PHP handles references within the loop, potentially modifying the original array elements in unintended ways. The solution demonstrates a safer method to avoid such problems.
